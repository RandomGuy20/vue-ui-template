## 3. Give basic folder structure for internal projects
## 4. Will install all needed dependencies to create a Vue project for Crestron Control Systems.
## 5. This Has your basic initial scripts, feel free to ONLY EDIT the scripts and nothing else in package.json, until you are more familiar with vite and Vue.
